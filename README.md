This is an Amazon Alexa game inspired by Lifeline developed in the HackUMass V, Nov, 3, 2017

### How Idea Comes

- Inspired by the game Lifeline, a text based game which helps a astronaut survive in the planet. The astronaut's action is totally based on the communication between YOU.
- Then we consider how to move this game to Amazon Echo, with the alexa, this amazing AI chat bot, we think we can create a voice version survival game.

### About How We Build it

- Main tool we use:
    - Alexa Skills Kit
    - Amazon Web Service (Lambda Function)
    - Node.Js

- How to use Alexa Skills Kit to develop games:
    - We use these two repos for main reference :
    [skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game) and [alexa-avs-sample-app](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app)

- Test and run:
    - Tested in Echo, thanks to MLH for providing Echo

### Others
- What we are proud of:
    - We build it ! Yeah !

- What problems we encountered:
    - This is the first time we use AWS, Alexa Skills Kit, so we have a lot of time in figuring out how to write functional code, and we spent a lot of time in configuring development environment. So most of the problems come from this part.

- Future plan:
    - more complicated script
    - tuned voice output so that alexa can have emotion
